### Step 2: Test Locally

```bash
cd .github/actions/llms-txt-generator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Build and bundle
npm run package

# Verify bundle exists and is reasonable size
ls -lh dist/index.js
```

Expected output:
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Bundle created successfully
- ✅ Bundle size < 5MB

### Step 3: Commit Everything

```bash
# From repository root
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add CI/CD pipeline and comprehensive testing"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify CI

1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Wait for CI workflow to complete
4. Verify all jobs pass

Expected result:
- ✅ Test job passes
- ✅ Integration test job passes
- ✅ Bundle job passes
- ✅ Lint job passes

### Step 5: Create First Release

```bash
cd .github/actions/llms-txt-generator

# Set version to 1.0.0
npm version 1.0.0

# Build and bundle
npm run package

# Commit bundle
cd ../../..
git add .github/actions/llms-txt-generator/dist/
git add .github/actions/llms-txt-generator/package.json
git add .github/actions/llms-txt-generator/package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: release v1.0.0"

# Push with tags
git push origin main --tags
```

### Step 6: Verify Release

1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Wait for Release workflow to complete
4. Go to "Releases" tab
5. Verify release v1.0.0 is created

Expected result:
- ✅ Release workflow passes
- ✅ GitHub release created
- ✅ Changelog generated
- ✅ v1 tag created
- ✅ Release assets attached

### Step 7: Test the Published Action

Create a test repository with:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-action.yml
name: Test Action

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Create test docs
        run: |
          mkdir -p docs
          echo "# Test Doc" > docs/test.md
          echo "This is a test." >> docs/test.md
      
      - name: Generate llms.txt
        uses: your-org/your-repo/.github/actions/llms-txt-generator@v1
        with:
          base-url: 'https://example.com'
          project-name: 'Test Project'
      
      - name: Verify output
        run: |
          cat llms.txt
          cat llms-full.txt
```

Expected result:
- ✅ Workflow runs successfully

- ✅ v1 tag points to v1.0.0
- ✅ Action works in test repository
- ✅ Documentation is accurate
- ✅ No critical bugs found

## 🔍 Verification Commands

Run these to verify everything:

```bash
# Check workflows exist
ls -la .github/workflows/

# Check documentation exists
ls -la *.md

# Check action structure
ls -la .github/actions/llms-txt-generator/

# Check bundle exists
ls -la .github/actions/llms-txt-generator/dist/

# Verify tests pass
cd .github/actions/llms-txt-generator
npm test
npm run test:integration

# Check for uncommitted changes
git status

# Check remote is correct
git remote -v

# Check current branch
git branch

# Check latest tag
git describe --tags --abbrev=0
```

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue: CI fails on first run

**Solution:**
1. Check workflow logs
2. Verify Node.js version
3. Check file paths
4. Ensure dependencies are installed

### Issue: Release workflow doesn't trigger

**Solution:**
1. Verify tag format (must start with 'v')
2. Check workflow file syntax
3. Ensure tag is pushed: `git push --tags`

### Issue: Action not found when testing

**Solution:**
1. Verify repository is public
2. Check action path is correct
3. Ensure release/tag exists
4. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to index

### Issue: Bundle is too large

**Solution:**
1. Check for unnecessary dependencies
2. Review what's being bundled
3. Use `npm run bundle` to rebuild
4. Consider excluding large files
